To enhance database performance, we recommend the following optimizations:

Indexing – Proper indexing ensures faster queries and better retrieval efficiency.
Searching by ID – Always use ID-based searches instead of String-based searches, as string lookups are slower and consume more resources.
Pagination – Instead of OFFSET, we should use Keyset Pagination for better performance in large datasets.
Caching – Implementing Redis caching reduces frequent database queries, improving response time.
Sharding – Splitting data across multiple databases enhances scalability and query efficiency.
Partitioning – Dividing large tables into smaller partitions improves query performance and reduces lookup time.
